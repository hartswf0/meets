# MEETS: Dissertation Research Archive

## About the Researcher

This archive documents a practice-based dissertation investigating how **thick prompts**—densely layered, context-rich instructions—transform human-AI collaboration from mechanical query-response into genuine creative dialogue. The work bridges media theory, cybernetics, and applied prompt engineering to develop new frameworks for understanding and practicing AI-mediated creation.

## Dissertation Argument

> **Thesis**: The quality of human-AI collaboration depends not on prompt "engineering" but on prompt *viscosity*—the degree to which instructions carry embedded context, cultural weight, and relational thickness.

### Key Claims

1. **Against Thin Prompts**: Single-line instructions produce thin outputs because they lack the contextual molasses that enables genuine creative friction.

2. **Cybernetic Molasses**: Thick prompts function as high-viscosity feedback signals—they slow down the system's response in productive ways, creating space for emergent meaning.

3. **Cultural Embedding**: The best prompts draw on thick description (Geertz), media theory (McLuhan), and cybernetic feedback (Bateson/Wiener) to create layered contexts.

4. **Worlding, Not Querying**: Effective prompting is about co-constructing a shared world, not extracting answers from a database.
